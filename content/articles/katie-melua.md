Melua has been referred to as an '[adrenaline junkie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline_junkie "Adrenaline junkie")' because she enjoys  [roller coasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster "Roller coaster")  and  [funfairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funfair "Funfair")  and often  [paraglides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragliding "Paragliding")  and  [hang glides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_gliding "Hang gliding")(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-27)  She has  [skydived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachuting "Parachuting")  four times and taken several  [flying lessons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator "Aviator"), and in 2004 she was lowered from a 200-metre (660 ft) building in New Zealand at 60 mph (97 km/h). When asked about Melua being an 'adrenaline junkie', Mike Batt said, "she enjoys extremes, but in life her emotions are always in check". (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-The_hitman_and_her-6)  In November 2009, Melua nearly drowned while diving in a lake near  [Heathrow Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport "Heathrow Airport"). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-28)

In September 2010, Melua was ordered by her doctors to stop working for a few months after suffering a  [nervous breakdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_breakdown "Mental breakdown"), resulting in her hospitalisation for six weeks. As a result, all touring and promotional activities were postponed until the following year.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-29)

Melua opened up about the breakdown years later in an interview with  _[The Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent "The Independent")_, saying that it ended up being one of the best things that had ever happened to her, as she said it helped to quash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesn't."(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-30)

In January 2012, Melua confirmed her  [engagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement "Engagement")  to  [World Superbike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbike_World_Championship "Superbike World Championship")  racer and musician  [James Toseland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Toseland "James Toseland" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-31)  The couple married on 1 September 2012 in the Nash Conservatory at the  [Royal Botanic Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Botanic_Gardens,_Kew "Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew")  in  [Kew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kew "Kew"), southwest London. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-32)  A 2020 interview with the national Swedish news agency TT revealed that the couple had separated. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-33)  Interviewed on ITV's  _Lorraine_  live from West London on 16 October 2020, Melua confirmed that the couple had divorced "(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-34)
